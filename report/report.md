## Project: Books CRUD API
The project aims at delivering a REST service allowing for retrieving, posting, updating and deleting data about books. 


## Test objective
* Testing is supposed to verify whether the CRUD services are (and continue to be) functional.
* Automated testing is suggested for monitoring the quality of the product.

## Test summary
Altogether, **2 test cases** have been performed both manually and in an automated fashion (see the files in the `tests` directory). Both test cases failed. They have revealed a defect that invalidates any further testing attempts until the defect is fixed.

## Defects
1 critical defect found (see `defects` directory).

## Recommendation
Given the severity of the found issue, QA recommends a **NO-GO** decision for the product.

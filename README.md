**Disclaimer**

The materials specified in the home assignment did not include a valid USER and PASSWORD to actually connect to the service and validate the CRUD operations. I chose to follow the YAGNI principle and only implement absolutely minimal set of automated test cases that allows to verify if the uncovered defect (authentication) is fixed. I did not implement an automated test case for PUT and DELETE, because a prerequisite for these 2 test would be a functionl GET and POST operation.
